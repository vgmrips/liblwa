Compilation
-----------
- Use CMake to generate a Makefile/project.
  You can enable/disable audio drivers, so you are free to build only what you need.

Required Libraries
------------------
- Under Linux, you will need to install additional packages before you can enable support for certain audio drivers.
    Note that you don't need **all** of these packages. You only need the libraries for sound systems you want support for.
	ALSA: libasound2-dev [Debian] / alsa-devel [SUSE]
	PulseAudio: libpulse-dev [Debian] / libpulse-devel [SUSE]
	libao: libao-dev [Debian] / libao-devel [SUSE]
- Under Windows, header files for WinMM and DirectSound should be included with MSYS or Visual Studio.
  Headers for XAudio2 are included with liblwa.
  For WASAPI support you need to use Visual Studio 2005 or higher and install the Windows SDK.
